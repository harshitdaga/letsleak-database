Perfect confidence is granted to the less talented as a consolation prize. ~Robert Hughes","Faith is taking the first step even when you can't see the whole staircase. ~Martin Luther King Jr.","You've got to learn your instrument. Then, you practice, practice, practice. And then, when you finally get up there on the bandstand, forget all that and just wail. ~Charlie Parker","When we walk to the edge of all the light we have and take the step into the darkness of the unknown, we must believe that one of two things will happen….There will be something solid for us to stand on or we will be taught to fly. ~Patrick Overton","Destiny is a feeling you have that you know something about yourself nobody else does. The picture you have in your own mind of what you're about will come true. ~Bob Dylan","The bird of paradise alights only on the hand that does not grasp ~John Berry","Success is not final, failure is not fatal — it is the courage to continue that counts. ~Winston Churchill","We know what we are, but not what we may be.  ~William Shakespeare","Most of the shadows of this life are caused by our standing in our own sunshine. ~Ralph Waldo Emerson","We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down. ~Kurt Vonnegut","Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met. It's gonna take awhile. It's normal to take awhile. You've just gotta fight your way through. ~Ira Glass","Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment ~Rumi","Let yourself go. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. ~E.M. Forster","We must be willing to let go of the life we planned in order to have the life that is waiting for us. ~Joseph Campbell","Only those that risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. ~T.S. Eliot","Talent is God-given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful ~ John Wooden","I have great faith in fools — my friends call it self-confidence. ~Edgar Allan Poe","Every day we slaughter our finest impulses. That is why we get a heartache when we read those lines written by the hand of a master and recognize them as our own, as the tender shoots which we stifled because we lacked the faith to believe in our own powers, our own criterion of truth and beauty. We are all kings, all poets, all musicians; we have only to open up to discover what is already there. ~Henry Miller","To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. To not dare is to lose oneself. ~Soren Kierkegaard","Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me… Anything can happen, child. Anything can be. ~Shel Silverstein","‎Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant. ~Robert Louis Stevenson","You can, you should, and if you're brave enough to start, you will. ~Stephen King","Take everything you like seriously, except yourselves. ~Rudyard Kipling","There are far better things ahead than what we leave behind ~C.S. Lewis","A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool. ~William Shakespeare","There are far better things ahead than what we leave behind ~C.S. Lewis","To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong. ~Joseph Chilton Pearce","The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek. ~Joseph Campbell","I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single think that I wanted to do. ~Georgia O'Keeffe","Do not be troubled for a language, cultivate your soul and she will show herself. ~Eugene Delacroix","We do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us something is valuable, worth listening to, worthy of our trust, sacred to our touch. Once we believe in ourselves we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight or any experience that reveals the human spirit. ~e.e. cummings","You are not too old and it is not too late to dive into your depths where life calmly gives out it's own secret ~Rilke","It's not denial. I'm just selective about the reality I accept. ~Calvin and Hobbes","It always seems impossible until it's done. ~Nelson Mandela","As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live. ~Goethe","The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt. ~Sylvia Plath","Give light and people will find the way. ~Ella Baker","One of the secrets of life is that all that is really worth the doing is what we do for others ~Lewis Carroll","Give what you have. To someone else it may be better than you dare to think ~Henry Wadsworth Longfellow","Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ~Buddha","Be there for others, but never leave yourself behind. ~Dodinsky","No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted ~Aesop","At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us.  ~Albert Schweitzer","The way to happiness: Keep your heart free from hate, your mind from worry. Live simply, expect little, give much. Scatter sunshine, forget yourself, and think of others. ~Norman Vincent Peale","To be an artist you have to give up everything, including the desire to be a good artist. ~Jasper Johns","We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men; and among those fibers, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as causes, and they come back to us as effects. ~Herman Melville","When you learn, teach, when you get, give. ~Maya Angelou","Talent is a gift that brings with it an obligation to serve the world, and not ourselves, for it is not of our making. ~Jose Marti","He neither serves nor rules, he transmits. His position is humble and the beauty at the crown is not his own. He is merely a channel ~Paul Klee","Live, travel, adventure, bless, and don't be sorry. ~Jack Kerouac","This world is but a canvas to our imagination. ~Thoreau","There are always flowers for those who want to see them. ~Henri Matisse","The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spider's web.  ~Pablo Picasso","Reality is whatever refuses to go away when I stop believing in it. ~Philip K. Dick","I would challenge you to a battle of wits, but I see you are unarmed! ~William Shakespeare","I shut my eyes in order to see. ~Paul Gauguin","To imagine is everything, to know is nothing at all. ~Anatole France","You need not leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet. ~Kafka","Silence is the mother of truth ~Benjamin Disraeli","It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see. ~Thoreau","No artist tolerates reality. ~Nietzsche","Who looks outside, dreams… who looks inside, awakes. ~Carl Jung","Think outside the box, collapse the box, and take a f**king sharp knife to it. ~Banksy","Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark place where it leads ~Erica Jong","We work in the dark, we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task.

There's a thin line between being brilliantly creative and acting like the biggest idiot on earth ~Cynthia Heimel","Not everyone is capable of madness; and of those lucky enough to be capable, not many have the courage for it. ~August Strindberg","The stupid believe that to be truthful is easy, only the artist, the great artist, knows how difficult it is. ~Willa Cather","One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. ~George Orwell","Being an author is having angels whisper in your ear – and devils, too. ~Graycie Harmon","‎Many people hear voices when no-one is there. Some of them are called mad and are shut up in rooms where they stare at the walls all day. Others are called writers and they do pretty much the same thing. ~Meg Chittenden","What I give form to in daylight is only one per cent of what I have seen in darkness. ~M.C. Escher","Work inspires inspiration. Keep working. If you succeed, keep working. If you fail, keep working. If you're interested, keep working. If you're bored, keep working. ~Michael Crichton","Write it. Shoot it. Publish it. Crochet it, sauté it, whatever — MAKE. ~Joss Whedon","Patience is also a form of action. ~Auguste Rodin","I believe humans get a lot done, not because we're smart, but because we have thumbs so we can make coffee. ~Flash Rosenberg","Stop talking.

Sometimes you have to go after it with a club. ~ Jack London","I'm killing time while I wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness. ~Calvin & Hobbes","Let your boat of life be light, packed with only what you need – a homely home and simple pleasures, one or two friends, worth the name, someone to love and someone to love you, a cat, a dog, and a pipe or two, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a little more than enough to drink; for thirst is a dangerous thing. ~Jerome K. Jerome","I don't wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to work ~Pearl S. Buck","Talent is cheap; dedication is expensive.

I write to be the characters that I am not. I write to explore all the things I'm afraid of. ~Joss Whedon","If you have to find devices to coax yourself to stay focused on writing, perhaps you should not be writing what you're writing. And if this lack of motivation is a constant problem, perhaps writing is not your forte. I mean, what is the problem? If writing bores you, that is pretty fatal. If that is not the case, but you find that it is hard going and it just doesn't flow, well, what did you expect? It is work; art is work. ~Ursula K. LeGuin","Don't market yourself. Editors and readers don't know what they want until they see it. Scratch what itches. Write what you need to write, feed the hunger for meaning in your life. Play at the serious questions of life and death. ~Donald M. Murray","You ask me why I spend my life writing? Do I find entertainment?  Is it worthwhile? Above all, does it pay? If not, then, is there a reason?… I write only because there is a voice within me. That will not be still. ~Sylvia Plath","You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children. ~Madeleine L'Engle","We do not write as we want, but as we can. ~W. Somerset Maugham","I sit in the dark and wait for a little flame to appear at the end of my pencil. ~Billy Collins","You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them. ~Ray Bradbury","One of the things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now. Something more will arise for later, something better. ~Annie Dillard"]
